<p>Are you interested in selling your vehicle, or are you wondering how much a certain used vehicle would cost? This program can help you calculate an estimated price of a used vehicle of your specification.</p>

<p>Given the make, model, trim, year, and mileage, as well as whether the vehicle 
is used or certified by the manufacturer, this program utilizes a dataset of 
9000+ used cars to calculate an estimated selling price of that particular vehicle*.</p>

<p>For an explanation of the code, see the <a href="https://github.com/wesleychou7/used-car-price/blob/main/Used%20Car%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb">Used Car Price Prediction.ipynb</a> file.</p>

<i>*The dataset consists mostly of cars manufactured in 2015-2022, so price predictions of cars outside this time frame may be inaccurate. Furthermore, the price predictions are more representative of the 2022 used car market than the current (2023) used car market.</i>
