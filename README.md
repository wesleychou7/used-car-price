<p>Are you interested in selling your car? Or are you curious about how much it would cost to buy one? This program can help you calculate an estimated price of a used vehicle of your specification.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Given the vehicle's make, model, trim, year, and mileage, and wether the vehicle is used or certified (by the manufacturer), this program utilizes a dataset of 
9000+ used cars to calculate an estimated selling price for that particular vehicle*.</p>

<p>For an explanation of the code, see the <a href="https://github.com/wesleychou7/used-car-price/blob/main/Used%20Car%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb">Used Car Price Prediction.ipynb</a> file.</p>

<i>*The dataset consists mostly of cars manufactured in 2015-2022, so price predictions of cars outside this time frame may be inaccurate. Furthermore, due to the dataset that was used, the price predictions are more representative of the 2022 used car market than the current (2023) used car market.</i>
